My name is Anthony Fu...

So, as you can see, at the frontend level, I am pretty much from the Vue community. And this is actually my second time attending a React event. But the event is awesome and really makes me feel home because we have a React conference with the color of Vue. Thanks to everyone that make this event possible. It's my great honor to speak and share my perspective with you here.

Since I don't know a lot of React to talk about, here is the deal, I will try to talk about something you might find interesting, and you gonna teach me how to properly use the `useEffect` hook later.
